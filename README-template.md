## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

처음에 Select Tip 부분을 그냥 버튼으로 만들었다가 그중 하나만 선택되는 거라 따로 스크립트를 짜는게 불필요하다 느껴 라디오 인풋으로 변경. 이때 Custom도 한번에 라디오로 묶을수 없나 생각했는데 딱히 해결책을 찾지 못해 그냥 라디오 인풋 5개와 텍스트 인풋 1개로 사용하기로 함.

이걸 하면서 input type="radio"를 써보게 되면서 https://github.com/changhoji/FAQ-accordion-card에서 js를 사용하지 않고 그냥 각 아코디언 메뉴를 radio 타입의 인풋으로 만들고 :checked인 인풋 뒤에 따라오는 텍스트의 display를 설정하는 방법으로 해도 되겠다는 생각을 했음. (js로 다른 애니메이션 효과나 복잡한 작업을 하지 않고 딱 그것만 했기에)

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```
